    <p>
        A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests.
    </p>
    <p>
         Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Skinless, Boneless Chicken Breast Halves-cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>All-purpose Flour</li>
        <li>Margarine</li>
        <li>Fresh Lemon Juice</li>
        <li>Fresh Mint Leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</li>
        
    </ol>
